# CIS-25
This C++ program defines a Product class that stores information about a product, including its ID, name, and price. The class uses a constructor to initialize these values when a Product object is created, and a destructor that displays a message when the object is destroyed. The program also includes a printDetails() method that outputs the product’s information to the screen. In the main() function, a Product object is created with sample values, and the program displays its details.
